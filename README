DeWall & InCoDe 
Two fast 3d Delaunay triangulators

This package contains:
        DeWall and InCode,      two 3d Delaunay triangulators. 
        Bubbles                 an utility for 2d-3d Dataset generation,

You can find more descriptive information in the two text files dewall.txt and 
incode.txt and in the PostScript file Delaunay.Triangulators.ps.


To install the whole package configure and run the makefile in this directory.
To build  a single program type 'make' followed by the name of the program,
i.e. to build DeWall type:
        make dewall
after configuring the Makefile.

To configure the makefiles you must edit them and modify some lines.  
To change the compiler change this line:

CC=gcc

and substitute 'gcc' with the name of your C compiler. Note that you need 
an ANSI C compiler. Sun user cannot use the native 'cc', but must install an 
ANSI C compiler as the GNU one (a public domain machine indipendent ANSI c/c++
compiler).

To change the machine settings uncomment the line relative to your machine 
removing the starting '#'. 

MYFLAGS = -O -I$(PWD)/../include -DSUN

Available machines:

- SunOs 4.1
- Hp-UX 8.05
- Silicon Graphics Irix 4.0
- Any machine with ANSI C compiler (Warning: inaccurate timings)
- MsDos 3.30 or later.

After configuring the Makefile type 'make' to build all the programs.

To build  a single program type 'make' followed by the name of the program,
i.e. to build DeWall type:
        make dewall

After building all you have four executables (incode, dewall, isosurf and 
bubbles)  that can be used as described in the documentation (incode.txt,
dewall.txt, isosurf.txt and bubbles.txt).
